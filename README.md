# MULTI-ENCRYPTION-AND-DECRYPTION-TOOL



### Functional Requirements:

#### 1. Encryption Methods
   - Implement classes for each encryption method (e.g., Morse Code, Caesar Cipher, Vigen√®re Cipher, Atbash Cipher, Polybius Square Cipher, ASCII Translation, Rail Fence Cipher).

#### 2. Real-time Interaction
   - Use a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit like JavaFX or Swing.
   - Implement event handlers to update results in real-time based on user input.

#### 3. User Interface
   - Design an intuitive GUI with clearly marked input and output sections.
   - Provide input fields, buttons, and text areas for user interaction.

#### 4. Database Integration
   - Utilize SQLite database connectivity to store and retrieve user messages, encrypted, and decrypted content.
   - Implement database CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

#### 5. Versatility
   - Allow users to choose from different encryption methods simultaneously.

#### 6. Displaying Results
   - Display encrypted and decrypted results with relevant details (encryption method, timestamps).

### Non-Functional Requirements:

#### 1. Performance
   - Optimize code for efficiency to handle real-time interaction with large volumes of text.

#### 2. Security
   - Implement secure database access and storage mechanisms to protect user data.

#### 3. Compatibility
   - Ensure compatibility with various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) using platform-independent Java.

#### 4. Scalability
   - Design the system to be easily extendable for future updates and additional encryption methods.

#### 5. Usability
   - Design an intuitive and user-friendly GUI for easy navigation.

#### 6. Documentation
   - Provide extensive documentation including a user manual and developer documentation.

#### 7. User Support
   - Establish a support mechanism (e.g., help desk, user forum) to assist users.

#### 8. Accessibility
   - Implement features to meet accessibility standards for users with disabilities.

### Implementation Suggestions:

1. **Use JavaFX or Swing for GUI development.**
2. **Utilize SQLite JDBC driver for database connectivity.**
3. **Organize code into classes for each encryption method.**
4. **Implement multithreading for real-time interaction without freezing the GUI.**
5. **Follow best practices for code readability, maintainability, and security.**
